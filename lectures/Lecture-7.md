## Additional Material

- This is a list of datasets you can download and experiment with
    - [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers): it contains information about people visiting the mall in a city. Columns include _gender_, _customer id_, _age_, _annual income_, and _spending score_. 
    - [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality): The dataset contains different chemical information about the wine. The dataset is suitable for classification and regression tasks.
